Steps to install:
=================

To compile the gkrellm-gkfreq.so file:
    make

If you want to try the plugin before installing you can run
    gkrellm -p gkrellm-gkfreq.so

Then install in either /usr/lib/gkrellm2/plugins/ by doing
    make install
or in /usr/local/lib/gkrellm2/plugins/ by doing
    make install-local
or in ~/.gkrellm2/plugins by doing
    make install-home

Now the plugin is installed. Start GKrellM and enable the gkrellm-gkfreq plugin.
